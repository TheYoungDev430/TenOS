skeepOS is a small operating system written in Python. It uses Windows to launch the programs inside it. WARNING: TenOS may not work due to you not having the .png files that it uses as its wallpaper
so to troubleshoot that, you need to make a folder in C:\ called DeskWWW. Then you create a drawing and save it there and name it r4.png (the wallpaper) and 
sd.png (for shutdown) Without this though, it still works. Thats all you need to know. SHA256: 827ce1981b4934737ee24d1b10830149b9cb4fbeb038357f7b95a10de6fde906
